## Functions added:
    
1. validInput:

Determines whether the input entered by the user is valid.  

The input is valid if the input amount is a number greater than 0.
If the amount entered is not a number or it is less than 1, the  
function returns false and will send the user the error message.  

2. Calculate:

Prompts the user to enter how much they spent on their needs and wants.  
It then calculates how much the user saved based on their current income.
If amount saved is less than 0, (meaning the user needs to use money from  
their savings), the function alerts the user that they are spending more  
than they need to. 

3. Pie Chart:

Shows the user a visual distribution of their expenses.
