		<p><strong>Hello, I'm Icram Doku, the creator and author of this website. I faced financial challenges and discovered the 50/30/20 Rule through my research. Implementing this rule proved effective for me, so I decided to share it with you.</strong></p>
		
		<p><strong>Hello, I'm Shreya Pradhan, contributing to this website created by Icram Doku. I added a calculate method that computes how much a user saved based on their income and expenses. Additionally, I incorporated a pie chart displaying their expense/savings distribution.</strong></p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>As a high school and now college student with a part-time job, I struggled to save money and disliked asking my parents for financial help. After researching, I found this simple rule, which has been easy for me to follow!</p>
		
		<p>This rule is especially useful for beginners. While it's great for forming a savings habit, if you're saving for significant expenses like a new car or a house, you'll eventually need to adjust the percentage of your savings.</p>
		
		<p>Now that the disclaimers are covered, enjoy experimenting with it. Improve your budgeting for future and prospective income.</p>
