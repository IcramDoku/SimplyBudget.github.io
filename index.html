		<h1>Simple Budget</h1>
		<hr>
		<p><b>Hello, my name is Icram Doku. I am the creator and author of this website. 
		I found myself struggling with money and did some research. I found this 50/30/20 
		Rule and started following it. It worked greatly for me, so I thought I should share 
		it.</b></p><br>
		<hr>
		<p>As a high school student (with a job) and now a college student, I still struggle to 
		save enough money. I hate asking my parent for money at the end of the month. So, 
		with some research, I found this simple rule and found it very easy to follow!</p>
	
		<p>Of course, this rule applies when you are a beginner (like me) to saving. If you
		are saving for a big purchase like a new car or a house, this will only help you to
		get in the habit of saving. You will gradually have to increase the percent of your
		saving!</p>
	
		<p>With the disclaimers out of the way, have fun! Play around with it. Budget better
		for future and prospect income.</p>
